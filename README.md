💡 The Story Behind Sheet Scan

From frustration to innovation

I've been playing clarinet since 4th grade, and those early years were rough. I'd sit there with random tuner apps covered in weird symbols I didn't understand, metronomes that felt impossible to follow, and YouTube recordings so old and out of tune they made everything sound worse. Half the time, I didn't even know if I was practicing right. I'd spend hours writing sharps and flats into my scales instead of actually learning how to make a better sound. It was frustrating enough that there were moments I seriously thought about quitting.
That's really where the idea for Sheet Scan came from—not some big tech vision, but from the real frustration of being a kid trying to get better at music with tools that didn't actually help. I wanted something that could explain rhythm visually, help me tune my instrument in a way that made sense, and connect me to good recordings so I could hear what I was aiming for.
