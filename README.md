The Story Behind Sheet Scan
I've been playing clarinet since 4th grade, and those early years were rough. I'd sit there with random tuner apps covered in weird symbols I didn't understand, metronomes that felt impossible to follow, and YouTube recordings so old and out of tune they made everything sound worse. Half the time, I didn't even know if I was practicing right. I'd spend hours writing sharps and flats into my scales instead of actually learning how to make a better sound. It was frustrating enough that there were moments I seriously thought about quitting.
That's really where the idea for Sheet Scan came from—not some big tech vision, but from the real frustration of being a kid trying to get better at music with tools that didn't actually help. I wanted something that could explain rhythm visually, help me tune my instrument in a way that made sense, and connect me to good recordings so I could hear what I was aiming for.
