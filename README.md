Sheet Scan brings all the essential practice tools beginners need into one intuitive app.
Instead of jumping between tuner apps, YouTube searches, scale sheets, and confusing metronomes, students get one reliable place to learn and practice correctly.

Available now on the App Store.

Overview

Sheet Scan is built to help students in band and orchestra:

Tune accurately with instrument-specific guidance

Learn scales with clear accidentals and fingerings

It bridges the gap between practice frustration and confident progress.

The Story Behind Sheet Scan

I’ve played clarinet since fourth grade, and early practice was often frustrating.
Most beginner tools felt overwhelming: tuners full of symbols, metronomes without visual cues, and hours spent hunting for decent recordings. Many days I wasn’t even sure if I was practicing correctly.

Sheet Scan came from wanting a tool I wish I had back then — something simple, clear, and actually helpful for young musicians learning the fundamentals.
